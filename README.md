# ArtemisII

The PDF files provide some information on the station and the operation of the S-band polarimeter I use.

See the RFI (Request For Interest) folder for my response to NASA to support the Artemis II mission. 

As the Artemis II mission advances I will post further technical details on the station here and later the actual data collected.
